# MOVIEHUB

Team8 - CS22022 Web statck development Assignment 2

**OVERVIEW:**

Our web application is called MovieHub. It is designed to help users find movies effortlessly and that are tailored to their preference. This app allows users to rate movies that they have seen and access movies that are similar to them. Users do have to login to their account to have access to the site and to rate films. The app also has an admin dashboard where the admins can delete movies and update passwords ect.This ensures that content always stays up to date. 

**OUR IMPLEMENTATION:**

For our **front end** we used HTML to create our application along with CSS on VS code to ensure we had a dynamic but also stylish interface. 
For our **back end** implentation we used flask. for this we were able to build RESTful APIs. We chose this for its flexibility and simplicity. 
My SQL was also used to create our database, which was used to store user profiles, ratings and movies.
